# AI-Based Credit Scoring Platform

This project aims to develop a platform leveraging AI and alternative data to provide credit scores for unbanked micro-entrepreneurs in emerging markets.

## Project Goal
Increase financial inclusion by providing reliable risk assessment tools for lenders evaluating borrowers without traditional credit histories.

## Overview
The platform ingests alternative data (e.g., mobile money transactions, utility payments), processes it, and uses Machine Learning models to generate credit scores. These scores are accessible to lenders via an API.

*(More details will be added as the project progresses, including setup instructions, architecture overview, and usage guidelines.)*
