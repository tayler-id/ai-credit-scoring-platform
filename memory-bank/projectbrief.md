# Project Brief: AI-Based Credit Scoring Platform

## Problem Statement
In many emerging markets, a significant portion of small businesses (SMEs) and individuals lack formal credit histories. Traditional financial institutions rely heavily on these histories to assess creditworthiness. Consequently, an estimated 40% of SMEs in these regions are unable to access necessary funding, hindering economic growth and individual opportunity (Source: worldbank.org). This lack of access to credit perpetuates cycles of poverty and limits entrepreneurial potential.

## Proposed Solution
Develop a software platform that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze alternative data sources for credit scoring. This approach aims to provide accurate risk assessments for individuals and micro-entrepreneurs who are currently 'unbanked' or 'underbanked' due to the absence of traditional financial records.

### Key Features:
*   **Alternative Data Integration:** Ingest and process diverse alternative data sets, including (but not limited to):
    *   Mobile money transaction history (e.g., M-Pesa, Wave)
    *   Utility payment records (electricity, water, internet)
    *   E-commerce platform activity (purchase history, seller ratings)
    *   Social media behavior patterns (requires careful ethical consideration and privacy safeguards)
    *   Supply chain data (for micro-entrepreneurs)
*   **AI/ML Credit Scoring Model:** Build and train ML models specifically tailored to local contexts and data nuances within target emerging markets. The model will predict credit risk and generate a credit score based on the analyzed alternative data.
*   **Platform Interface:** Provide an interface for lenders (potentially MFIs, fintechs, or even traditional banks adapting their models) to access credit scores and risk profiles. An interface for borrowers to understand their score drivers might also be considered.

## Source & Credibility
Research indicates that ML models utilizing alternative data can outperform traditional credit scoring methods, particularly for populations with thin or non-existent credit files. These models have shown promise in extending credit access to previously unserved or underserved segments (Source: seejph.com). The proposed solution is speculative but grounded in these research findings and the growing field of fintech for financial inclusion.

## Core Goals
*   Increase financial inclusion for unbanked micro-entrepreneurs.
*   Provide lenders with reliable risk assessment tools for alternative borrowers.
*   Develop a scalable and adaptable platform applicable to various emerging market contexts.
*   Ensure ethical data handling and model fairness.
