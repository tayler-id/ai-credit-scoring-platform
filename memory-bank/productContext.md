# Product Context: AI-Based Credit Scoring Platform

## Why This Project Exists
*   To address the significant gap in credit access for unbanked micro-entrepreneurs in emerging markets.
*   To leverage alternative data and AI/ML to create fairer and more inclusive financial systems.
*   To provide lenders with better tools to assess risk for non-traditional borrowers.

## Problems It Solves
*   Lack of credit history preventing access to loans.
*   High operational costs for lenders trying to assess thin-file borrowers manually.
*   Potential biases in traditional lending models that exclude viable borrowers.
*   Limited economic growth potential due to constrained access to capital for micro-entrepreneurs.

## How It Should Work (High-Level)
*   Securely ingest various forms of alternative data.
*   Clean, process, and featurize the data for ML models.
*   Train and validate ML models to predict creditworthiness based on alternative data patterns.
*   Generate a credit score and potentially a risk profile.
*   Provide an API or platform interface for lenders to query scores.
*   (Future) Potentially offer insights to borrowers on how to improve their score.

## User Experience Goals
*   **For Lenders:** Simple, reliable, fast access to credit scores; clear presentation of risk factors; trustworthy and transparent model outputs (explainability is key).
*   **For Borrowers (if applicable):** Easy-to-understand feedback; actionable insights.
*   **For Platform Admins:** Robust monitoring, easy model updates, secure data management.
