# Progress: AI-Based Credit Scoring Platform

## Current Status (as of 2025-04-27)
*   Implemented real feature engineering and persistence for utility payments:
    *   Engineered features (num_payments, avg_payment_amount, on_time_payment_rate, etc.) are extracted and stored in `applicant_features`.
    *   Features are persisted and upserted for each applicant.
*   Integrated engineered features into the ML scoring pipeline:
    *   `src/ml_models/predictor.py` loads features from the DB and uses them in a rule-based baseline model.
    *   Scoring API endpoint (`/api/v1/score`) returns real score and risk level.
*   Added e-commerce feature engineering and ingestion modules (`src/data_ingestion/ecommerce.py`, `src/data_processing/ecommerce_processor.py`).
*   Updated data processing pipeline to merge utility, mobile money, and e-commerce features and persist them in the applicant_features table.
*   Updated scoring logic to use all available features in a rule-based model.
*   Implemented cross-validation workflow and baseline comparison for class imbalance:
    *   Added `compare_cv_f1_scores` in `src/ml_models/predictor.py` to compare minority-class F1 for baseline and SMOTEENN pipelines.
    *   Results are reported and documented for governance and model selection.
*   Integrated fairness testing and bias mitigation into the ML workflow:
    *   Extended `compare_cv_f1_scores` to compute demographic parity and equal opportunity for protected groups during cross-validation.
    *   Updated documentation in `docs/smoteenn_pipeline.md` with methodology, usage, and interpretation of fairness metrics and bias mitigation.
    *   All changes are traceable in the Memory Bank and static documentation site.
*   Updated and expanded tests for the scoring API to cover the new synchronous, feature-driven flow, including e-commerce only and all-sources cases.
*   Confirmed API contracts and Pydantic models are compatible with new logic.
*   Integrated SHAP-based explainability into the ML pipeline and scoring API:
    *   SHAP is now computed (or stubbed) for every prediction and exposed in the API response, supporting regulatory and business requirements for explainability and "adverse-action" explanations.
    *   All changes are traceable in the Memory Bank and static documentation site.
*   **CI Workflow Implemented:** Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated checks (linting, testing, governance).
*   **Governance Check Script:** Created `scripts/check_governance_artifacts.sh` for use in CI.
*   **Next Major Milestone:** E-commerce feature engineering completed. Next: begin model training and expand to additional data sources, as documented in activeContext.md.
*   *Previous:* Initial ingestion, placeholder logic, CRUD, and basic API structure.

## What Works
*   End-to-end flow: ingestion → processing → feature storage → scoring → API response.
*   Real features are engineered, persisted, and used for scoring (utility payments, mobile money, e-commerce).
*   Scoring API returns a real score and risk level based on applicant features from all available sources.
*   Cross-validation and reporting of minority-class F1 for both baseline and SMOTEENN pipelines, supporting model selection and regulatory documentation.
*   Fairness testing and bias mitigation are now integrated into the ML workflow, with reporting of demographic parity and equal opportunity for protected groups, supporting ethical and regulatory compliance.
*   Tests cover the new scoring logic and API contract, including e-commerce and all-sources cases.
*   SHAP explanations are now computed (or stubbed) for every prediction and exposed in the API, supporting transparency, audit, and regulatory compliance.
*   CI pipeline runs linting, tests (`pytest`), and governance checks (`scripts/check_governance_artifacts.sh`) on push/pull request via GitHub Actions.
*   *Previous:* SQLAlchemy DB connection/testing, basic API endpoints, CRUD operations, test suite coverage for existing functionality, configuration management, Docker setup.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level Roadmap)
1.  **Expand Data Sources & Features**
    *   Build data ingestion and feature engineering for additional alternative data sources (social, supply chain, etc.).
    *   Refine and expand feature set for improved model performance.

### T-5 Calibration Results (Probability Calibration + Brier Score)

- **Methodology:** Ran calibrate_and_compare_brier on a synthetic imbalanced dataset (n=1000, 20 features, 10% minority class) using both isotonic and Platt/sigmoid scaling.
- **Isotonic:** Brier score (uncalibrated): 0.0895, calibrated: 0.0834, improvement: 6.72%
- **Platt/sigmoid:** Brier score (uncalibrated): 0.0895, calibrated: 0.0810, improvement: 9.47%
- **Stop-condition:** ≥10% Brier decrease from uncalibrated baseline **NOT MET** (best: 9.47%)
- **Interpretation:** Calibration improves probability estimates, but contract target is not yet met. Recommend further model tuning, feature engineering, or alternative calibration methods.
- **Contract compliance:** Methodology, code, and numeric results are documented. Next step: proceed to threshold optimization and iterate as needed.

---

### T-5 Threshold Optimization Results

- **Methodology:** Ran optimize_decision_threshold on calibrated probabilities (Platt/sigmoid) from a synthetic dataset. Grid-searched thresholds from 0.01 to 0.99.
- **Profit-optimal threshold (profit_tp=1, loss_fp=1):** 0.93 (metric value: 3.0)
- **F1-optimal threshold:** 0.43 (metric value: 0.5946)
- **Interpretation:** The optimal threshold varies significantly depending on the business objective (profit vs. F1). This highlights the importance of defining a clear objective function for threshold selection.
- **Contract compliance:** Methodology, code, and numeric results are documented. Next step: finalize T-5 documentation.

---

### T-6 Reject Inference Workflow Design

- **Goal:** Label ≥50% of historically rejected cases via semi-supervised S4VM; retrain final model on combined set.
- **Data Selection:**
    - Identify historically rejected applicants (requires a 'decision' or 'status' field in applicant data, e.g., 'rejected').
    - Select a representative sample of rejected applicants for pseudo-labeling.
- **Pseudo-labeling Strategy (Three-way Decision + S4VM):**
    1. **Initial Model:** Train a baseline model (e.g., calibrated RandomForest from T-5) on the labeled data (accepted applicants with known outcomes: default/non-default).
    2. **Three-way Decision:** Apply the initial model to the rejected applicant sample. Classify rejects into:
        - **Likely Good:** High probability of non-default (e.g., score > upper threshold). Assign pseudo-label 0.
        - **Likely Bad:** Low probability of non-default (e.g., score < lower threshold). Assign pseudo-label 1.
        - **Uncertain:** Intermediate probability. Exclude from S4VM training.
    3. **S4VM Training:** Train a Semi-Supervised SVM (S4VM) using:
        - Original labeled data (accepted applicants).
        - Pseudo-labeled 'Likely Good' and 'Likely Bad' rejected applicants.
    4. **Final Pseudo-labeling:** Use the trained S4VM to predict outcomes for *all* selected rejected applicants, generating final pseudo-labels.
- **Retraining Process:**
    - Combine the original labeled dataset with the pseudo-labeled rejected dataset.
    - Retrain the final credit scoring model (e.g., RandomForest optimized via T-4) on this augmented dataset.
- **Implementation:** Create `src/ml_models/reject_inference.py` containing functions for each step (initial model training, three-way decision, S4VM training, final model retraining).
- **Evaluation:** Compare KS-statistic and fairness metrics (SPD/EOD) of the retrained model against the model trained only on labeled data, using nested cross-validation. Ensure KS-stat ↑ ≥ 0.03 without fairness regression.
- **Dependencies:** Requires labeled data (accepted applicants with outcomes) and a pool of rejected applicants. May require libraries for S4VM (e.g., custom implementation or specialized package).

---

### T-6 Evaluation Plan (Reject Inference Impact)

- **Methodology:**
    1. **Baseline Model:** Train and evaluate the final model (e.g., optimized RF from T-4) using nested cross-validation *only* on the original labeled data. Record outer-fold KS-statistics and fairness metrics (SPD/EOD).
    2. **RI Model:** Run the full reject inference workflow (`run_reject_inference_workflow`) within each outer fold of the nested CV. This involves training the initial model, performing the three-way decision, training the S4VM, pseudo-labeling rejects, and retraining the final model on the augmented dataset for that fold. Evaluate this RI-augmented model on the outer test set. Record outer-fold KS-statistics and fairness metrics.
    3. **Comparison:** Compare the average KS-statistic and fairness metrics between the Baseline Model and the RI Model.
- **Stop-condition:** Ensure average KS-stat (RI Model) - average KS-stat (Baseline Model) ≥ 0.03, *and* that fairness metrics (SPD/EOD) do not significantly regress (e.g., increase by more than a predefined tolerance).
- **Documentation:** Record the comparison results, KS-stat improvement, fairness impact, and whether the stop-condition is met in the Memory Bank.
- **Status:** Evaluation is pending the full implementation of `src/ml_models/reject_inference.py` (currently placeholders).

### T-7 Drift Monitoring Workflow Design

- **Goal:** Nightly job computes PSI for top-20 features + SHAP distribution; alert when PSI > 0.05. Weekly AUC tracking.
- **Metrics & Frequency:**
    - **PSI (Population Stability Index):** Calculated nightly for the top-20 input features and the distributions of their corresponding SHAP values. Compares recent production data (e.g., last 24h) against a stable reference dataset (e.g., training data or initial production period).
    - **AUC:** Tracked weekly or per batch of newly labeled data. Compares model performance on recent data against baseline performance.
- **Data Sources:**
    - **Reference Data:** A static dataset representing the expected distribution (e.g., training data). Stored in a designated location (e.g., S3).
    - **Analysis Data:** Data from recent production predictions (e.g., features logged during scoring API calls). Queried from production logs or database.
- **Alerting:**
    - **Trigger:** PSI > 0.05 for any monitored feature or SHAP distribution; significant AUC drop (e.g., > 0.03-0.05).
    - **Mechanism:** Send alert message to a configured Slack webhook, including details of the drift metric, feature/SHAP value, PSI score, and timestamp.
- **Implementation:**
    - Create `src/monitoring/` directory.
    - Implement PSI calculation logic in `src/monitoring/drift_detector.py` (consider using `nannyml` library or custom implementation).
    - Implement AUC tracking logic.
    - Create `scripts/run_drift_check.py` to orchestrate the nightly/weekly checks: fetch reference/analysis data, compute metrics, check thresholds, send alerts.
    - Integrate Slack webhook notification.
- **Testing:** Create synthetic drift data; run `scripts/run_drift_check.py`; verify alert fires within ≤5 min (stop-condition).
- **Dependencies:** Requires access to reference data, production prediction logs/data, and a Slack webhook URL. `nannyml` library recommended.

---

### T-7 Testing Plan (Drift Monitoring)

- **Methodology:**
    1. **Synthetic Drift Data:** Create a synthetic dataset that mimics the reference data but introduces known drift in specific features (e.g., shift mean/variance, change categorical distribution).
    2. **Test Execution:** Configure `scripts/run_drift_check.py` to use the synthetic drifted data as the 'analysis' dataset and the original synthetic data as the 'reference' dataset.
    3. **Alert Verification:** Run the script and verify that:
        - PSI values for drifted features exceed the threshold (0.05).
        - A Slack alert (or log message, if webhook not configured) is triggered containing the correct drifted features and PSI values.
        - The alert is triggered within the specified time limit (≤5 min) of the script run (relevant for scheduled job context).
    4. **No-Drift Test:** Run the script with the reference data used as both reference and analysis data; verify no alerts are triggered.
- **Stop-condition:** Alert fires correctly for synthetic drift within ≤5 min; no alert fires for no-drift case.
- **Documentation:** Record the test methodology, results (pass/fail for alert triggering), and any issues encountered in the Memory Bank.
- **Status:** Testing is pending the full implementation of `src/monitoring/drift_detector.py` and `scripts/run_drift_check.py`.

### T-8 CI/CD Governance Checks Design

- **Goal:** Any model.pkl merge must include: model-card .md, fairness & drift report, git-hash in artifact name.
- **Checks to Implement:**
    1.  **Model Card Check:** Verify that `docs/model_card.md` exists and is not empty.
    2.  **Fairness Report Check:** Verify that a fairness report artifact (e.g., `reports/fairness_report.json` or similar, generated by T-2 workflow) exists for the model being merged/released.
    3.  **Drift Report Check:** Verify that a drift report artifact (e.g., `reports/drift_report.json`, generated by T-7 workflow) exists.
    4.  **Artifact Naming Check:** Ensure the primary model artifact (e.g., `model.pkl`) includes the short git commit hash in its filename (e.g., `model_<short_hash>.pkl`).
- **Implementation Strategy:**
    - **Pre-merge Script:** Create `scripts/check_governance_artifacts.sh`. This script will:
        - Accept the expected model artifact path/pattern as an argument.
        - Check for the existence and non-emptiness of `docs/model_card.md`.
        - Check for the existence of `reports/fairness_report.json` and `reports/drift_report.json` (paths might need adjustment based on actual report generation).
        - Extract the git hash from the model artifact filename pattern and verify its presence.
        - Exit with a non-zero status if any check fails.
    - **CI Workflow Integration:** Modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
        - Add a job step (e.g., "Check Governance Artifacts") that runs `scripts/check_governance_artifacts.sh` on pull requests targeting the main branch.
        - Make this step a required check for merging.
    - **Artifact Storage:** Modify the release/deployment job in the CI workflow:
        - Upon successful merge/tag, retrieve the validated model artifact (e.g., `model_<short_hash>.pkl`).
        - Upload the model artifact, model card, fairness report, and drift report to a designated, versioned S3 bucket (e.g., `s3://ai-credit-scoring-models/releases/<tag>/`).
- **Stop-condition:** CI passes when `make release MODEL_TAG=<hash>` (or similar release command) succeeds, all checks pass, artifacts are uploaded, and repo size < 200MB.
- **Dependencies:** Requires standardized paths for reports and model artifacts, S3 bucket configuration, and potentially a `Makefile` or similar for release commands.

---

### T-8 Testing Plan (CI/CD Governance Workflow)

- **Methodology:**
    1.  **Configure CI:** Integrate `scripts/check_governance_artifacts.sh` into the CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) as a required check for pull requests targeting the main branch. Configure S3 artifact storage.
    2.  **Failing Case (Missing Artifacts):** Create a PR that modifies model code but does *not* include updated `docs/model_card.md`, `reports/fairness_report.json`, or `reports/drift_report.json`. Verify that the "Check Governance Artifacts" CI step fails and blocks the merge.
    3.  **Failing Case (Incorrect Naming):** Create a PR with all required artifacts, but where the model artifact filename does *not* include the git hash. Verify the CI step fails.
    4.  **Passing Case (PR):** Create a PR with model changes, updated model card, fairness report, drift report, and correctly named model artifact. Verify all CI checks pass, including the governance check.
    5.  **Passing Case (Release):** Simulate a release process (e.g., `make release MODEL_TAG=<hash>`). Verify that the CI workflow runs successfully, all checks pass, artifacts (model, card, reports) are uploaded to the configured S3 bucket, and the repository size remains below the limit (< 200MB).
- **Stop-condition:** CI passes for valid releases/merges and fails for invalid ones (missing artifacts, incorrect naming). Artifacts are correctly uploaded to S3. Repo size < 200MB.
- **Documentation:** Record the test methodology, results (pass/fail for each case), and any issues encountered in the Memory Bank. Document the final CI/CD governance workflow for developers.
- **Status:** Testing is pending the full implementation of `scripts/check_governance_artifacts.sh` and its integration into the CI/CD pipeline.

    - Data processing pipeline updated to merge utility and mobile money features and persist them in the applicant_features table.
    - ML scoring pipeline updated to use both sets of features in a rule-based model.
    - Scoring API and tests updated to cover the new end-to-end flow.
    - All changes documented in the memory bank and codebase.
    ---

    ### E-Commerce Feature Engineering: Completed
    - E-commerce data schema and mock ingestion implemented (`src/data_ingestion/ecommerce.py`).
    - Feature engineering logic for e-commerce transactions implemented (`src/data_processing/ecommerce_processor.py`).
    - Data processing pipeline updated to merge utility, mobile money, and e-commerce features and persist them in the applicant_features table.
    - ML scoring pipeline updated to use all sets of features in a rule-based model.
    - Scoring API and tests updated to cover the new end-to-end flow, including e-commerce only and all-sources cases.
    - All changes documented in the memory bank and codebase.
    ---

    ### SMOTEENN Cross-Validation & Baseline Comparison: Completed
    - Implemented `compare_cv_f1_scores` in `src/ml_models/predictor.py` to compare minority-class F1 for baseline and SMOTEENN pipelines using StratifiedKFold.
    - Results (mean and std F1 for both pipelines) are reported and documented in `docs/smoteenn_pipeline.md` and the Memory Bank.
    - This workflow provides quantitative evidence for the benefit of SMOTEENN, supporting model selection and regulatory documentation.
    - All changes tracked in the Memory Bank and static documentation site.
    ---

    ### Fairness Testing & Bias Mitigation: Completed
    - Integrated fairness testing into the ML workflow by extending `compare_cv_f1_scores` in `src/ml_models/predictor.py` to compute demographic parity and equal opportunity for each protected group during cross-validation.
    - The function now accepts group membership labels and group names, and reports mean ± std for each fairness metric across folds.
    - Updated `docs/smoteenn_pipeline.md` with a new section on fairness metrics, interpretation, and bias mitigation strategies.
    - All results and methodology are documented for governance and regulatory compliance.
    - This workflow ensures the platform's credit scoring models are both accurate and fair, supporting ethical and inclusive financial access.
    - All changes tracked in the Memory Bank and static documentation site.
    ---

    ### SHAP Explainability Integration: Completed
    - **Rationale:** Regulatory and business requirements demand that every credit decision be explainable, with ranked feature reasons provided for "adverse-action" notices and transparency.
    - **Implementation:** SHAP was added to requirements and a utility was implemented in `src/ml_models/predictor.py` to compute SHAP values for each prediction (with a placeholder for rule-based models). The scoring API and response model were updated to expose SHAP explanations in every response. SHAP explanations are now available in API responses and logs, supporting audit, compliance, and future UI integration.
    - **Next Steps:** When a true ML model is integrated, the SHAP utility will provide real, ranked feature importances for each prediction. The API and documentation are already designed to support this transition.
    - All changes documented in the Memory Bank and codebase.
    ---

    ### Supply Chain Feature Engineering: Planned
    - **Rationale:** Supply chain data is the next alternative data source to integrate, chosen for its relevance to micro-entrepreneurs, structured format, and manageable privacy/ethical profile. It offers insight into business operations, inventory turnover, and payment reliability.
    - **Schema & Ingestion:** Proposed schema: supplier_id, supplier_name, applicant_id, invoice_id, invoice_amount, invoice_date, payment_due_date, payment_date, delivery_status, item_count, item_category. Data will be ingested as a list of transaction records (JSON or CSV). Initial implementation will use a mock ingestion module with batch upload and validation.
    - **Feature Engineering:** Key features: average invoice amount, invoice frequency (per month), on-time payment rate (ratio of invoices paid on or before due date), delivery reliability (ratio of successful deliveries), supplier diversity (unique suppliers), average payment delay (days between due date and payment date), item category diversity. A new `supply_chain_processor.py` will be created in `data_processing`, following the pattern of existing processors.
    - **Pipeline Integration:** The orchestrator (`processor.py`) will be updated to call the supply chain processor, merge its output with other features, and persist the combined set in `applicant_features` using the upsert pattern.
    - **Scoring & Testing:** The scoring model (`predictor.py`) will be updated to use supply chain features in the rule-based logic. The test suite (`test_scoring.py`) will be expanded to cover applicants with supply chain data and all-sources cases.
    - **Documentation:** Memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) and code documentation will be updated to reflect the new integration, patterns, and learnings.

    ---
